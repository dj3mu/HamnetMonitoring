# `Hamnet` Monitoring Service
A background servic that polls the monitoring values at a defined interval and provides a REST API to query the data.

The service can be run by a simple [systemd unit file](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files).

Configuration is done using an `appsettings.json` file for the service settings as well as a `log4net.config` for the logging settings.
